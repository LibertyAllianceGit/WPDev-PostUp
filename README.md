WPDevelopers | PostUp
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that integrates with PostUp so that you can gather subscribers. You can configure me on the options page by adding your PostUp login and password, and then you can use my provided shortcode to output sign-up forms with built-in AJAX submission for a smooth user experience. Along with my shortcode come attributes, so that you can define specific lists, placeholder text, and submission button text too!

Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the WPDev PostUp options screen to configure the plugin.
